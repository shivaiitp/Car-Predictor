# Car Price Predictor üöóüìà

A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts the price of a car based on various features like year, mileage, brand, fuel type, etc. The app combines a React + Tailwind CSS frontend with a Node.js + Express backend serving predictions using a Linear Regression model trained via Python.

## ‚ú® Features
- Predicts car prices using a trained Linear Regression model
- Clean and responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Interactive form to collect input features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed to understand feature relationships

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
